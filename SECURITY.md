## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: [REPLACE_WITH_EMAIL]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Response Time**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and assess the vulnerability
- **Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We will work to resolve the issue promptly
- **Credit**: We will acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

## Security Best Practices for Selenium Testing

When using this Selenium framework, please follow these security guidelines:

### 1. Credential Management
- ❌ **NEVER** hardcode credentials in test scripts
- ✅ Use environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ Use secure credential management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- ✅ Store test credentials separately from production credentials

### 2. Test Data Security
- ❌ **NEVER** use production data in tests
- ✅ Use synthetic or anonymized test data
- ✅ Implement data masking for sensitive information
- ✅ Regularly clean up test data

### 3. Browser Security
- ✅ Use headless mode when possible to reduce attack surface
- ✅ Disable unnecessary browser features and plugins
- ✅ Use latest browser versions with security patches
- ✅ Configure browser security settings appropriately

### 4. Network Security
- ✅ Run tests in isolated network environments
- ✅ Use HTTPS for all external communications
- ✅ Implement proper firewall rules
- ✅ Monitor network traffic during tests

### 5. Code Security
- ✅ Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Use static code analysis tools
- ✅ Implement proper input validation
- ✅ Follow secure coding practices

### 6. CI/CD Security
- ✅ Secure CI/CD pipelines with proper access controls
- ✅ Use secrets management in CI/CD systems
- ✅ Implement security scanning in pipelines
- ✅ Monitor and log CI/CD activities

### 7. Access Control
- ✅ Implement role-based access control
- ✅ Use principle of least privilege
- ✅ Regular access reviews and updates
- ✅ Multi-factor authentication where applicable

## Security Tools and Dependencies

We recommend using the following security tools:

### Dependency Scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **Snyk**: Vulnerability scanning for dependencies
- **OWASP Dependency Check**: Open source dependency scanner

### Code Analysis
- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis
- **SonarQube**: Static code analysis
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **ESLint Security Plugin**: JavaScript security linting

### Browser Security
- **OWASP ZAP**: Web application security scanner
- **Burp Suite**: Web vulnerability scanner
- **Selenium with security headers**: Check for security headers

## Secure Configuration Examples

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Good: Use environment variables
export TEST_USERNAME="${TEST_USERNAME}"
export TEST_PASSWORD="${TEST_PASSWORD}"
export TEST_URL="${TEST_URL}"
```

### Browser Configuration
```python
# Good: Secure Chrome options
chrome_options = Options()
chrome_options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")
chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-extensions")
chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-plugins")
chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-images")
chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")  # When possible
```

### Test Data Management
```python
# Good: Use configuration files with environment-specific data
import os
from configparser import ConfigParser

config = ConfigParser()
config.read('config/test_config.ini')

username = os.getenv('TEST_USERNAME', config['DEFAULT']['username'])
password = os.getenv('TEST_PASSWORD')  # Always from environment
```

## Regular Security Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies and tools updated
2. **Security Reviews**: Conduct regular security reviews of test code
3. **Penetration Testing**: Include security testing in your test suites
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor test environments for security incidents
5. **Training**: Ensure team members are trained on security best practices
