# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Selenium.git
cd Selenium

# Create a virtual environment (Python)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Guidelines

### Code Security

1. **Never commit sensitive data**:
   - Passwords, API keys, tokens
   - Personal information
   - Production configuration
   - Browser profiles or cached data

2. **Use secure coding practices**:
   - Input validation
   - Proper error handling
   - Secure default configurations
   - Principle of least privilege

3. **Dependency management**:
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review new dependencies for security issues
   - Use lockfiles to ensure reproducible builds

### Testing Security

1. **Test data**:
   - Use only synthetic test data
   - Never use production data
   - Implement data cleanup after tests

2. **Browser security**:
   - Use headless mode when possible
   - Configure secure browser options
   - Disable unnecessary features

3. **Environment isolation**:
   - Test in isolated environments
   - Use containerization when possible
   - Clean up test artifacts

## üìù Code Style

### General Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style in the repository
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Write self-documenting code

### Language-Specific Guidelines

#### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes

#### JavaScript/Node.js
- Use ESLint configuration
- Follow modern ES6+ syntax
- Use JSDoc for documentation

#### Java
- Follow Google Java Style Guide
- Use JavaDoc for documentation
- Follow Maven/Gradle conventions

## üß™ Testing

### Test Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

1. **Unit tests** for individual functions/methods
2. **Integration tests** for component interactions
3. **Security tests** for security-related features
4. **End-to-end tests** for complete workflows

### Running Tests

```bash
# Python
pytest tests/
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src

# Node.js
npm test
npm run test:coverage

# Java
mvn test
mvn verify
```

### Test Guidelines

- Write clear, descriptive test names
- Use arrange-act-assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Include security-focused test cases

## üìã Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. **Security check**:
   - Run security scans on your code
   - Check for credential exposure
   - Validate secure configurations

2. **Code quality**:
   - Run linters and formatters
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Check code coverage

3. **Documentation**:
