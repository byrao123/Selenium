# Selenium Test Automation Framework

A secure and robust Selenium-based test automation framework designed with security best practices in mind.

## üîí Security First

This project prioritizes security throughout the development and testing lifecycle. Please review our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) before contributing or using this framework.

### Key Security Features

- ‚úÖ Comprehensive `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive data commits
- ‚úÖ Secure credential management guidelines
- ‚úÖ Browser security configurations
- ‚úÖ Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- ‚úÖ Static code analysis integration
- ‚úÖ Security-focused CI/CD pipeline

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ or Node.js 16+ (depending on implementation)
- WebDriver binaries (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/byrao123/Selenium.git
cd Selenium

# Install dependencies (Python example)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or for Node.js
npm install
```

### Basic Usage

```python
# Python example with secure configuration
import os
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

# Secure Chrome configuration
chrome_options = Options()
chrome_options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")
chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-extensions")
chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")  # Recommended for CI/CD

# Use environment variables for configuration
test_url = os.getenv('TEST_URL', 'https://example.com')
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)

try:
    driver.get(test_url)
    # Your test code here
finally:
    driver.quit()
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Guidelines

### DO ‚úÖ

- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Implement proper credential management
- Use synthetic test data only
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use headless browsers in CI/CD
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security scanning and reviews

### DON'T ‚ùå

- Hardcode credentials in test scripts
- Use production data in tests
- Commit sensitive files to version control
- Run tests with elevated privileges unnecessarily
- Use outdated browser drivers or dependencies
- Expose test environments to public networks

## üìã Testing

```bash
# Run security checks
npm run security:check

# Run tests with security validation
npm run test:security

# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (not committed to git) with your configuration:

```bash
# Test environment configuration
TEST_URL=https://staging.example.com
TEST_USERNAME=test_user
TEST_PASSWORD=secure_password_from_vault
BROWSER=chrome
HEADLESS=true
```

### Browser Security Settings

This framework includes secure browser configurations by default:

- Disabled unnecessary plugins and extensions
- Security headers validation
- Network isolation options
- Minimal browser permissions

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Review our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md)
2. Follow secure coding practices
3. Include security tests with your changes
4. Update documentation as needed

### Security Reviews

All contributions undergo security review:

- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Credential exposure detection
- Security best practice validation
